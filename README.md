# Calculator Emulator

#### *This calculator is an ISEN student project made by Tom LORIDANT.*

## I. Functionalities

This calculator can realize simple operations (addition `+`, substraction `-`, division `/` and multiplication `*`).  

It also can understand functions included in the keys of the calculator.  

You can also graph a function by using the `Graph` button (using x in the expression), or going back to operation mode using `Calc`.  

It can pretty much **understand every kind of mathematical expression** included on calculator's keys.

***Note: This code doesn't use `eval()` method once.***


## II. Usage

You can use calculator's buttons or use the keyboard to enter an expression.into the calculator.  

- To get the result you can either press `=` (calculator or keyboard) or `Enter` (keyboard).
- Type functions using buttons or keyboard to type.
- Move the cursor to delete or insert element at a specific place using left and right arrow.

## III. Code structure

- `index.html`: Structure file for web page
- `style.css`: Style file
- `calcInterpretation.js`: File containing all the code related to the mathematical expression interpretation, and outputs a result
- `script.js`: File containing the code related to page animation and user interface/experience
